	<h1>Final Pitch</h1>
	<h2>Topic</h2> <p> Who are the H1B Visa holders?</p>
	<h2>Questions to be answered</h2> 
	<ul>
		<li>Who are the H1B Visa holders?
		<li>Where are they from? 
		<li>What is the percentage of successful application?
		<li>What is the average salary of the H1B holders?
		<li>What fields are they working in?
		<li>How many of them are international students?
	</ul>
	<h2>Data source</h2><p>H1B visa allows US employers to temporarily employ foreign workers in specialty occupations. <a href="http://www.myvisajobs.com/Reports/2013-H1B-Visa-Category.aspx?T=JT">My Visa Jobs.com </a>shows the top H1B Visa Job Title. I want to dig into the data to see which fields need most specialties from foreign countries.</p>
	<p>Furthermore, <a href="http://www.flcdatacenter.com/caseh1b.aspx">the Foreign Labor Certification Data Center</a> ,<a href="http://www.foreignlaborcert.doleta.gov/performancedata.cfm"> United State Department of Labor</a> and <a href="http://catalog.data.gov/dataset/h-1b-program-historical-data">Data.Gov</a> have the data on H1B holders, both historical and current data. With the data, the questions above could be answered. </p>
	<p>If necessary, <a href="http://www.iie.org/Research-and-Publications/Open-Doors/Data/International-Students/Enrollment-Trends/1948-2012">Institute of International Education </a>has data on international students with which I can know more about the percentage of international students from each country who can get H1B visa. </p>
	<h2>Human source</h2><p>If possible, I want to interview some H1B Visa holders from different fields. I also want to interview the international students from the fields in which few people get H1B visa. And I will also talk to some experts on foreign labor to get more information of the job market in the USA and try to figure out why certain area need more international specialties.</p>
