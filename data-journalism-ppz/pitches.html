	<h1>Project 1:How many defending champions are there in the Olympic history? </h1>
	<p>
		In my opinion, there are two types of Olympic games, depending on whether referees score during the game. Games like track and field and swimming belong to one type. Diving and figure skating belong to the other category. <br>
		By analyzing the data, the project tries to find out how many defending champions there are in the Olympic history because it is an uneasy achievement. Also, I am courious to find outwhether there are obvious differences in the number of defending champions between the two types of games.<br><br>
		Data Source: <a href="http://www.olympic.org/ioc">IOC</a><br><br>
		I am not sure about the layout of the project. I want to find a way to present the data beautifully and efficiently.

	<h1>Project 2:The return rate of online shopping</h1>
	<p>
		ABC reported that one-third of online shopping transactions get returned in the December, 2013. It is kind of interest, to me. Through this project, I want to compare the return rate of online shopping and physical store shopping. And I also want to compare the return rate of different categories such as clothes, food, toys, etc. to see if there are big differences. If so, I will also figure out the reasons behind it and maybe collect some possible solutions to it.<br><br>
		Data Source:I find it hard to find large scale of data on this issue. <a href="http://www.commerce.gov/">Maybe Department of Commerce </a>has some data I need. Also, I am thinking about using the data of certain company Walmart, Macy's etc.<br><br>
		I think this project could be a blog. It contains several chats (or interactive chats), and also an article.

	<h1>Project 3:The teen suicide rate in the US</h1>
	<p>
		I came up with the idea basically because one of my school-mate in high school committed suicide last week because of persecutory delusion. Through this project, I want to figure the trend of teen suicide rate in the USA (maybe by state) and the reason behind the trend. If possible, I also want to figure out the trend of teen suicide rate because of mental health problems. <br><br>
		Data source: <a href="http://www.cdc.gov/ViolencePrevention/Suicide/statistics/index.html">center for disease control ad prevention</a> (I am trying to find more data)<br><br>
		This project could be an interactive map on the suicide rate bt state. As for the reasons and the deaths caused by mental health problems, maybe chats will be a better choice?
