	<h1>Project 1</h1>
	<h2>How many defending champions are there in the Olympic history?</h2>
	<p>
		In my opinion, there are two types of Olympic games, depending on whether the referees are scoring during the game. Games like track and field and swimming belongs to one type. Diving, figure skating, etc. belong to the other type. <br>
		By analyzing the data, the project tries to find out how many defending champions there are in the Olympic history and whether there are obvious differences in the number of defending champions between the two types of games.<br><br>
		Data Source: <a href="http://www.olympic.org/ioc">IOC</a>

	<h1>Project 2</h1>
	<h2>The return rate of online shopping</h2>
	<p>
		ABC reported that one-third of online shopping transactions get returned. Through this project, I want to compare the return rate of online shopping and physical store shopping. And I also want to compare the return rate of different categories such as clothes, food, toys, etc. and figure out the reasons behind it.<br><br>
		Data Source:I find it hard to find large scale of data on this issue. <a href="http://www.commerce.gov/">Maybe Department of Commerce </a>has some data I need. Also, I am thinking about using the data of certain company Walmart, Macy's etc.

	<h1>Project 3</h1>
	<h2>The teen suicide rate in the US</h2>
	<p>
		I came up with the idea basically because one of my school-mate in high school committed suicide last week because of persecutory delusion. Through this project, I want to figure the trend of teen suicide rate and the reason behind the trend. If possible, I want to figure out the trend of teen suicide rate because of mental health problems. <br><br>
